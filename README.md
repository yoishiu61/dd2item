If you don't have a second profile created already:

-you will need to create a second profile.

If there's a profile 3 already created for you:

-either delete that profile 3 OR change all instances of "profile_3" in the names of these files.



after that you should be fine. Just paste these files into your "profiles" folder. It's here:
C:\Users\<User Name>\AppData\LocalLow\RedHook\Darkest Dungeon II\SaveFiles\<Numbers>\profiles
